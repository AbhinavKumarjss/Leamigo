## Implementation

Data Handling: All plan and usage data is loaded from a local JSON file (esimData.json), simulating a real backend.

Routing & State: Uses Next.js routing and React state for navigation and UI interactivity.

Styling: Tailwind CSS ensures a clean, modern, and responsive design, closely matching the provided reference images.
Componentization: Reusable components (e.g., UsageBar, PlanCard, Header) keep the code modular and maintainable.

Accessibility & UX: Focused on clear typography, color contrast, and intuitive layout for a user-friendly experience.
